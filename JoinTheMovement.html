      <h2>ONE PERSON, ONE COMMUNITY, ONE CITY AT A TIME</h2>
      <p>
        SparkAmerica is focused on building Fit & Healthy leaders all across the
        country. We do that by implementing programs in SparkCities - urban and
        suburban localities whose business and civic leaders have joined with us
        to create community and promote healthy living. We are proud of the work
        being done and the partnerships we've formed in each of these cities,
        and of the friendly competition we see each year as they strive to be
        the healthiest SparkCity in America!
      </p>
