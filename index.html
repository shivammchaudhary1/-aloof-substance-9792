      <h4>More About SparkPeople Closing</h4>
      <p>
        We want to thank you for inviting us to be a part of your journey and
        for the privilege of earning your support and enthusiasm for the brand.
        SparkPeople's business model has always been free and was driven by
        advertiser support, a model that became difficult to maintain in recent
        years. With many larger technology companies emerging in the health and
        fitness space, we struggled to compete for the same advertising dollars
        that would keep the site online and alive. Unfortunately, it costs many
        millions of dollars per year to run SparkPeople, and the burden
        eventually became too much. <br />
        <br />
        SparkAmerica is part of our new business model, in which we work with
        companies and organizations to help keep their employees healthy with
        <a href="">PeopleOne Health.</a> Not only does this business model allow
        us to expand our health offerings to more people, but it also does a
        much better job of paying the bills and will likely allow us to hire
        more people over time to keep improving our tech offerings. We're very
        excited that we can open up our website and app for this business while
        keeping it free to help all individuals and organizations in the United
        States achieve their health and fitness goals.
